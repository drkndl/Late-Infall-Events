1. Load .vtk file
2. Click on gasdens600.vtk in the pipeline tree on the left
3. Click Apply

Changing coordinates
--------------------
1. Click on Filters > Alphabetical > Clean to grid
2. Click Apply
3. Click on Calculator > check Coordinate Results 
4. Add following formula in the empty box: coordsX*sin(coordsY)*cos(coordsZ)iHat + coordsX*sin(coordsY)*sin(coordsZ)jHat + coordsX*cos(coordsY)*kHat
5. Click on Save Expression below the formula box
6. Click Apply 

Loading isosurfaces
-------------------
1. Click on Calculator in the pipeline tree on the left so that the isosurfaces are under calculator pipeline.
2. Click on "Generate isolines or isosurfaces" in the toolbar.
3. In 'Isosurfaces' in the Properties dialog box, click on the Red X in the Value Range where a single data point is listed.
4. Click on empty square above the Red X to add new range of values for isosurfaces.
5. Add range in "Generate number series" dialog box that opens up.
6. Choose "Logarithmic" for Type if applicable.
7. Choose appropriate number of samples. Higher the number, greater is the RAM load.
8. Scroll down to "Styling" to change opacity as necessary.
9. Scroll down to "Coloring" to change colormap as necessary. (see below)

Changing data threshold
-----------------------
1. Click on Calculator in the pipeline tree on the left so that the thresholds are under calculator pipeline.
2. Click on "Extract cells that satisfy a certain threshold criterion" in the toolbar.
3. Change Threshold Method as necessary. Note that "Above upper threshold" actually requires us to provide a lower threshold from which the datapoints are filtered.
4. Change Threshold values as necessary.
5. Click on Apply.

Switch between views
--------------------
1. Click on eye in the pipeline tree to toggle a specific 'filter' on or off

Change colormap Properties
--------------------------
1. Ensure you have chosen the right filter in the pipeline tree to which you want to change the colormap properties.
2. Click on Edit Colormap on the toolbar.
3. Click on "Set a colormap from default presets" to change the type of colormap. Check "Use log scale when mapping data to colours".
4. Click on "Rescale to custom data range" on the toolbar to add a custom range for the colormap in the dialog box that opens.
5. Click on "Toggle colorbar visibility" to toggle colorbar on/off.
